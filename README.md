# Picopic

Picopic is a small web service for optimizing images. It consists of a React frontend
running at https://picopic.io/, and a backend exposing an API at https://api.picopic.io/.
Currently, the service can be used to optimize PNG images via a web browser.

This is a hobby project. Its purpose was to teach me more about the different AWS services,
serverless/microservice architecture, and infrastructure as code using [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).
Everything in the project, from frontend to backend including all the AWS services, is defined
in code.
